# Console-based Notepad Application

A file creation/editing tool similar to Notepad, but with added search and suggestions features!üìù<br>
The work in this repository encompasses my second and third assignments for my data structures course. It was definitely one of the most challenging assignments I have had to do, but the exposure to such a variety of data structures provided me with a valuable learning journey.

## Features
* Editing text in files (specifically .txt files), implemented using a 2D Doubly Linked List (4 way pointers)
* Undo/redo functionality for up to 5 words, implemented using stacks
* Searching for words in text, implemented using a dynamically updating trie tree
* And suggestions for word and sentence completion based on existing text, implemented using a special Chilli Tree!

## Version History
* initial release

Please feel free to give any feedback! :)
